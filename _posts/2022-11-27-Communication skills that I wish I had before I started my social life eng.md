Since before to start social life I heard so many times like "Communication is important", "You should to grow communication skill because of not working alone".
But I thought no problem when I doing social life because my friend relationship was smoothed until now and I experienced team project many times.

But real social communication was so different I experienced until now.

To find each others same things not easy because around people was not similar my age and each others grew environment and background was all different until now.
I can't felt comfortable like talk with friends usually, I felt difficult to talk about private story because that relationship was public.

To held mind and effort again yourself but that was not changed easily and my look in company was different my look in real when time go more and more.
Talking count was decreased and I sensitived people's wits then I felt skepticism moment of social life was more.

Once I rationalized yourself like "Early social life", "Age young yet", "Small experience because didn't graduate from college", "My original character is that".

But that is all excuse.

Age is not important in social completely.
Communication is one skill also, don't excuse with young age should to change yourself.

### People is most interested to yourself

After taking group photo who you check first in photo?
Mostly people zoom the photo and find yourself first.

Like this people is most interested to yourself and also like to talk about yourself in communication process.
But talk counterpart also human then do not naturally more like to talk about yourself than hear other's story?

Listening is most important in communication.
Communication is tired and no fun with who don't listen counterpart story and talking about yourself.

But just because communication is important you don't must only listening 100% in communication process.
You can should talk about yourself confidently as communication is talk with other people.

### If you take interested to other people first then conversation is made

Sometimes moment is made to talk with met first people or not familiar people.
Awkward is natural and it is at a loss how to talking.
Whenever that you should to think people is most interested to yourself.

Ask first to counterpart what usually interested in and what you like.
Then counterpart is answer about question, if couterpart is can listening then them ask to you the other way also.
Asked question and answered to each others like this then conversation is being make and can find each others similar thing.

But it is difficult to expect good result in formal conversation by pushed unavoidable.
Person is more interested to yourself than counterpart then it is not easy naturally to heard counterpart spoke.

The more you should interested counterpart sincerely more and talk.
It is not easy but also not impossible, if you make interest in counterpart then communication is fun and instructive.

Remember communication's core is counterpart it just not me.

### Do choose same bond of sympathy talk topic

Some person like exercise and another person like car, person is all different.
Choose talk topic differently by counterpart is good when you doing communication.
Check beforehand is will helpful what counterpart interested in usually.

If you don't know about counterpart then talk about recently social hot issue is also good method.
Do think talk topic that can make each others bond of sympathy like news, netflix, youtuber.

Confidence is most important element in communication.
Have confidence and try to lead conversation first when you doing communication.
Counterpart is also person like me so won't you wait for someone to pay attention to yourself first?

### It is not important this relationship is where met.

This relationship met by public but should I talk private story?, should I close to them why bother?, I thought.
This think is very wrong and dangerous.
Right now my around of people also met by chance when in life.

But people met by public what is different?
It is not different completely.
But you do communication predicate yourself that people only met and talk in company.
Naturally get good result is difficult and it will be formal.

![social-life]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/22-11-06/social-life.jpg)

Also some people think like this.
This relationship met by public but they do communication with think about this relationship's future value like this "Because don't know future", "Networking is important".
Also it is not wrong but this relationship is not good I think.

If you grow up to adult and social life period is more and more then meet friend purely is difficult in fact than childhood.
When you make relationship you find additional elements continually and build wall that not show by eyes yourself.

But this purpose relationship and formal communication is how long valid?
Is this relationship helpful when you leave out company, be deprived in high rank, have difficult moment?

Make relationship person to person like when we made friend purely in childhood.
Have interest in counterpart truly and show heart you want friendly with counterpart.
Is this relationship that made by heart is not continually consist value when time go?

### Life is same bus that not fixed route map

Previously I heard "Life is same bus that not fixed route map" and agreed but I don't know where heard.

Bus driver is yourself and various people ride bus on various station during my life period.
Don't get off is good who ridden on bus but when each others destination is different how can do ride continually.

![bus]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/22-11-06/bus.jpg)

No method all of people don't get off on bus.

But is not correct effort to maximum to make them comfortable and fun when they were on the bus as driver responsibility?
Should make they can think like this "This bus is comfortable", "Driver is kind", "Current I get off but when I have chance next time I want to ride bus again".

In conclusion, think from counterpart position and do consideration is made success communication result always.

But always excessive is not good.
Don't lose yourself because you take care of counterpart.
Keep appropriate line and try change slowly your interest from yourself to counterpart.

It is not easy never but try effort hardly and everyone become to be best driver in your life. üòè
